# BlogSite

copyright Shanav Nath

simple music blog webiste created using Html, Css, Javascript, and Bootstrap for artist YCG Nav.

Once the idea for the site was created I first created the html for each of the pages as well as the navbar.
After that adding images and text was straightforward, as was adding the form for the contact us page.
Getting the blogpage to update once adding a blogpost was the most difficult aspect of the project, but using 
Bootstrap's media objects simplified the css needed and I just put them into a table that updated after a form submission.
